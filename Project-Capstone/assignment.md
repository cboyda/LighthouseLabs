# Project Description

This project will give you an opportunity to apply your learnings from the entire program to leverage data to explore a problem and present your findings. Upon completion, you will present the project to your cohort mates and the public at a Demo Day event. This is an individual project.
Goal

In the project you must:

Set a well-defined problem with impact clearly identified;

Execute the data analysis techniques learned throughout the program;

Demonstrate insights and potential solutions via a dashboard that incorporates best practices of data visualization and is appropriate for a non-technical audience;

Create instructions for users to interact with the dashboard.

## Outcomes

Through this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:

Apply data analysis techniques to explore a problem of your choosing

Showcase your insights through an impactful stakeholder-facing dashboard

Add a valuable project to your portfolio to leverage during interviews

## Phases

There will be 5 phases involved in completing your capstone project:

* Project Planning
* Project Setup
* Project Workflow
* Project Development
* Project Presentation

Let's go through each of these phases.
### 1. Project Planning

In the planning phase, you’ll prepare several documents to help guide you through the execution of your project.

Deadline: Should have been finished and reviewed by a mentor in week 6 day 5.
a) Project Description

Fill in the Final Project Document shared with you in Discord. It should contain at least the following:

Project title
Goal you try to achieve
Project description - What problem your project solves

Deliverable: Project description document
### 2. Project Setup

To start off on the right foot, you’ll need a good project setup:
a) Git repo setup

Create a repo on GitHub.
b) Access to Data

Data gathering is one of the most important parts of the project. Sometimes, it can take a lot of time and data we find are not completely as we expected. Make sure to plan enough time for this step.

Deliverable: Data are ready
### 3. Project Workflow
a) Project Communication

Conduct daily check-ins in your "Scrum" Discord channel that we will create for you. This is where you will track your progress, accomplishments, and hurdles.

Deliverable: Daily Scrum Check-Ins
b) Project Workflow

You need to take a few key decisions to ensure a smooth project workflow. Ideally, you should think about the following:

What are the project milestones: you need to create a list of the project milestones and specify what are the deadlines.

Deliverable: Project milestones document
### 4. Project Development

You should work on the development of your project according to your feature list and project milestones. Be aware that there is a Demo Day coming on Week 8 Day 4 and you need to keep enough time for polishing results, making a presentation and to prepare yourself for Demo Day.
5. Project Presentation

It’s important to take some time to structure the presentation of your project.

Who is the target audience:

You have 2 targets: Employers and the public. For prospective employers you should focus on what you’ve accomplished, highlight - your skills, the technologies you used. For the public, it’s more about the user experience.
You should have demonstrate your final dashboard and show how a potential stakeholder could use it to gain insights into a business problem. Try not to show your code during the presentation since the most of the audience won't be able to understand it properly.
Audio/video setup: it’s important that you check your setup to ensure that everything works.
Presentation practice: It’s important to practice before Demo Day. You should practice in front of a mentor so you can get some feedback.

Deadlines: - Practice Demo (with mentors): Demo Day minus 1 - Demo Day
