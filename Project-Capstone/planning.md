# Capstone Project Planning
from [Lighthouse Compass W6D1](https://data.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/17b51bd2-2dd9-4d5b-95e8-7a431060db74)

There will be 5 phases involved in completing your capstone project:

1. Project Planning
2. Project Setup
3. Project Workflow
4. Project Development
5. Project Presentation

Let's go through each of these phases.
## 1. Project Planning

In the planning phase, you’ll prepare several documents to help guide you through the execution of your project.

Deadline: Finished and reviewed by a mentor on week 6 day 5.
a) Project Description

Fill in the Final Project Document shared with you in Discord. It should contain at least the following:

* Project title
* Goal you try to achieve
* Project description - What problem your project solves

Deliverable: Project description document
## 2. Project Setup

To start off on the right foot, you’ll need a good project setup:
a) Git repo setup

Create a repo on GitHub.
b) Access to Data

Data gathering is one of the most important parts of the project. Sometimes, it can take a lot of time and the data we find are not completely as we expected. Make sure to plan enough time for this step.

Deliverable: Data are ready
## 3. Project Workflow
a) Project Communication

Conduct daily check-ins in your "Scrum" Discord channel that we will create for you. This is where you will track your progress, accomplishments, and hurdles.

Deliverable: Daily Scrum Check-Ins
b) Project Workflow

You need to take a few key decisions to ensure a smooth project workflow. Ideally, you should think about the following:

* What are the project milestones: you need to create a list of the project milestones and specify what are the deadlines.

Deliverable: Project milestones document
## 4. Project Development

You should work on the development of your project according to your feature list and project milestones. Be aware that there is a Demo Day coming on Week 8 Day 4 and you need to keep enough time for polishing results, making a presentation and preparing yourself for Demo Day.
## 5. Project Presentation

It’s important to take some time to structure the presentation of your project.

Who is the target audience:
* You have 2 targets: Employers and the public. For prospective employers, you should focus on what you’ve accomplished, and highlight - your skills, and the technologies you used. For the public, it’s more about the user experience.
* You should have demonstrated your final dashboard and shown how a potential stakeholder could use it to gain insights into a business problem. Try not to show your code during the presentation since most of the audience won't be able to understand it properly.
* Audio/video setup: it’s important that you check your setup to ensure that everything works.
* Presentation practice: It’s important to practice before Demo Day. You should practice in front of a mentor so you can get some feedback.

Deadlines: - Practice Demo (with mentors): Demo Day minus 1 - Demo Day
