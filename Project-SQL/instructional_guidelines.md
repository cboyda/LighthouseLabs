Evaluation Guidelines

Here are some things youâ€™ll need to keep in mind for this evaluated project:

    Familiarize yourself with the Eval Rubric tab so you can read about the competencies you will be evaluated on for this particular project and review what the different levels of each competency require.
    If you receive Unsatisfactory for any competency, your project will be rejected. If this happens, you will need to review the feedback provided, make changes to your project based on that, and resubmit your updated project within 48 hours in order to get it accepted and stay on track. This is not a bad thing! Having to resubmit is an opportunity for you to improve.
    Please ensure that you submit your project immediately following your presentation to help ensure you get feedback as soon as possible.
